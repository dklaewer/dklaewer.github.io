In view of the Emergent String Conjecture, this tower must either induce a decompactification or correspond to the emergence of a tensionless critical string. We study the consistency conditions implied by this conjecture on the asymptotic behaviour of quantum gravity under dimensional reduction. If the emergent string descends from a (2+1)-dimensional membrane in a higher-dimensional theory, we find that such a membrane must parametrically decouple from the Kaluza-Klein scale. We verify this censorship against emergent membrane limits, where the membrane would sit at the Kaluza-Klein scale, in the hypermultiplet moduli space of Calabi-Yau threefold compactifications of string/M-theory. At the classical level, a putative membrane limit arises, up to duality, from an M5-brane wrapping the asymptotically shrinking special Lagrangian 3-cycle corresponding to the SYZ fibre of the Calabi-Yau. We show how quantum corrections in the moduli space obstruct such a limit and instead lead to a decompactification to eleven dimensions, where the role of the M5- and M2-branes are interchanged.","arxiv":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09136","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.066024","journal":"Phys.Rev.D","image":"/static/7ea2610a74da6d1f38117cc4c914617d/membrane-limits.svg"},{"id":2,"title":"Modular Curves and the Refined Distance Conjecture","authors":["Daniel Kläwer"],"abstract":"We test the refined distance conjecture in the vector multiplet moduli space of 4D \\\\(\\\\mathcal{N}=2\\\\) compactifications of the type IIA string that admit a dual heterotic description.

Limits in which the tension of the asymptotically tensionless string sits at the Kaluza-Klein scale, by contrast, are not obstructed. In the second part of the paper we study the effect of quantum corrections for the Weak Gravity Conjecture away from the strict weak coupling limit. We propose that gauge threshold corrections and mass renormalisation effects modify the super-extremality bound in four dimensions. For the infinite distance limits in F-theory the classical super-extremality bound is generically satisfied by a sublattice of states in the tower of excitations of an emergent heterotic string. By matching the F-theory \\\\(\\\\alpha\'\\\\) corrections to gauge threshold corrections of the dual heterotic theory we predict how the masses of this tower must be renormalised in order for the Weak Gravity Conjecture to hold at the quantum level.","arxiv":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00024","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP03(2021)252","journal":"JHEP","image":"/static/7b8c90ba19f037d7d92ae5c58de885b6/emergent-strings.svg"},{"id":4,"title":"KKLT and the Swampland Conjectures","authors":["Ralph Blumenhagen","Max Brinkmann","Daniel Kläwer","Andriana Makridou","Lorenz Schlechter"],"abstract":"Recently, various swampland conjectures have been proposed that every UV complete effective field theory should satisfy.

First, we define and analyze the relevant effective field theory for the conifold modulus and the overall Kähler modulus that both have exponentially small masses. The scalar potential still admits KKLT-like AdS and dS minima. Second, we critically analyze the reliability of the employed Wilsonian effective action by evaluating the masses of light modes localized in the warped throat. The resulting mass spectrum is discussed with respect to the swampland distance conjecture. We find the recently observed emergent nature of the latter not only at large distance points but also at the conifold point motivating a general extension of it. In this respect, KKLT and trans-Planckian field distance are on equal footing. It is pointed out that the reliability of the KKLT minimum will depend on how this emergent behavior is interpreted.","arxiv":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07724","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP05(2019)152","journal":"JHEP","image":""},{"id":6,"title":"A Spin-2 Conjecture on the Swampland","authors":["Daniel Kläwer","Dieter Lüst","Eran Palti"],"abstract":"We consider effective theories with massive fields that have spins larger than or equal to two.

The cutoff can be understood as the Weak Gravity Conjecture applied to the Stückelberg gauge field in the mass term of the high spin fields. A strong version of our conjecture applies even if the graviton itself is massive, so to massive gravity.

While a naive approach of training a neural network to reproduce the cohomologies fails in the general case, by inspecting the underlying functional form of the data we propose a second approach. The cohomologies depend in a piecewise polynomial way on the line bundle charges. We use unsupervised learning to separate the different polynomial phases.
