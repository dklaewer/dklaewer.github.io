            It is expected that infinite distance limits in the moduli space of quantum gravity are accompanied by a tower of light states. In view of the Emergent String Conjecture, this tower must either induce a decompactification or correspond to the emergence of a tensionless critical string. We study the consistency conditions implied by this conjecture on the asymptotic behaviour of quantum gravity under dimensional reduction. If the emergent string descends from a (2+1)-dimensional membrane in a higher-dimensional theory, we find that such a membrane must parametrically decouple from the Kaluza-Klein scale. We verify this censorship against emergent membrane limits, where the membrane would sit at the Kaluza-Klein scale, in the hypermultiplet moduli space of Calabi-Yau threefold compactifications of string/M-theory. At the classical level, a putative membrane limit arises, up to duality, from an M5-brane wrapping the asymptotically shrinking special Lagrangian 3-cycle corresponding to the SYZ fibre of the Calabi-Yau. We show how quantum corrections in the moduli space obstruct such a limit and instead lead to a decompactification to eleven dimensions, where the role of the M5- and M2-branes are interchanged.

            We test the refined distance conjecture in the vector multiplet moduli space
            of 4D \(\mathcal{N}=2\) compactifications of the type IIA string that admit a
            dual heterotic description. In the weakly coupled regime of the heterotic
            string, the moduli space geometry is governed by the perturbative heterotic
            dualities, which allows for exact computations. This is reflected in the type
            IIA frame through the existence of a K3 fibration. We identify the degree
            \(d=2N\) of the K3 fiber as a parameter that could potentially lead to large
            distances, which is substantiated by studying several explicit models. The
            moduli space geometry degenerates into the modular curve for the congruence
            subgroup \(\Gamma_0(N)^+\). In order to probe the large \(N\) regime, we initiate
            the study of Calabi-Yau threefolds fibered by general degree \(d>8\) K3 surfaces
            by suggesting a construction as complete intersections in Grassmann bundles.

            We study quantum corrections in four-dimensional theories with \(N=1\) supersymmetry in the context of Quantum Gravity Conjectures. According to the Emergent String Conjecture, infinite distance limits in quantum gravity either lead to decompactification of the theory or result in a weakly coupled string theory. We verify this conjecture in the framework of \(N=1\) supersymmetric F-theory compactifications to four dimensions including perturbative \(\alpha'\) as well as non-perturbative corrections. After proving uniqueness of the emergent critical string at the classical level, we show that quantum corrections obstruct precisely those limits in which the scale of the emergent critical string would lie parametrically below the Kaluza-Klein scale. Limits in which the tension of the asymptotically tensionless string sits at the Kaluza-Klein scale, by contrast, are not obstructed. In the second part of the paper we study the effect of quantum corrections for the Weak Gravity Conjecture away from the strict weak coupling limit. We propose that gauge threshold corrections and mass renormalisation effects modify the super-extremality bound in four dimensions. For the infinite distance limits in F-theory the classical super-extremality bound is generically satisfied by a sublattice of states in the tower of excitations of an emergent heterotic string. By matching the F-theory \(\alpha'\) corrections to gauge threshold corrections of the dual heterotic theory we predict how the masses of this tower must be renormalised in order for the Weak Gravity Conjecture to hold at the quantum level.

            Different techniques from machine learning are applied to the problem of computing line bundle cohomologies of (hypersurfaces in) toric varieties. While a naive approach of training a neural network to reproduce the cohomologies fails in the general case, by inspecting the underlying functional form of the data we propose a second approach. The cohomologies depend in a piecewise polynomial way on the line bundle charges. We use unsupervised learning to separate the different polynomial phases. The result is an analytic formula for the cohomologies. This can be turned into an algorithm for computing analytic expressions for arbitrary (hypersurfaces in) toric varieties.

            The Swampland Distance Conjecture claims that effective theories derived from a consistent theory of quantum gravity only have a finite range of validity. This will imply drastic consequences for string theory model building. The refined version of this conjecture says that this range is of the order of the naturally built in scale, namely the Planck scale. It is investigated whether the Refined Swampland Distance Conjecture is consistent with proper field distances arising in the well understood moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau compactification. Investigating in particular the non-geometric phases of Kahler moduli spaces of dimension \(h^{1,1}\in \{1,2,101\}\), we always found proper field distances that are smaller than the Planck-length.

            We study scenarios where a scalar field has a spatially varying vacuum expectation value such that the total field variation is super-Planckian. We focus on the case where the scalar field controls the coupling of a \(U(1)\) gauge field, which allows us to apply the Weak Gravity Conjecture to such configurations. We show that this leads to evidence for a conjectured property of quantum gravity that as a scalar field variation in field space asymptotes to infinity there must exist an infinite tower of states whose mass decreases as an exponential function of the scalar field variation. We determine the rate at which the mass of the states reaches this exponential behaviour showing that it occurs quickly after the field variation passes the Planck scale.
